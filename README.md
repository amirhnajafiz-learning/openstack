```OpenStack``` is a software and hypervisor manager which helps us to create, manage, and remove virtual machines on single or multiple nodes.
By node I mean a live computer or server that has an static IP address. ```OpenStack``` helps us to create virtual machines
on bare metal hardware too.

In order to provide these services, ```OpenStack``` uses various components to create virtual cpus, virtual network, virtual volumes,
and virtual routers. It uses ```KVM```. In this presentation we are going to talk about different components of ```OpenStack``` and
see how they work and integrate with each other. After that we are going to install ```OpenStack``` on our local machine in order to
manage some virtual machines.
